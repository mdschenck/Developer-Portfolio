            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, thanks very much for visiting my page. I am a web development
              student and designer based in Atlanta, Georgia currently working
              in specialty food ecommerce Digital Merchandising. I started
              building web pages back in the infancy of the world wide web in
              1997, designing a page for a music project I was involved with.
              Over the years, I've built sites for different businesses I've
              been involved in, including multiple specialty food retailers,
              recording studios, and record labels. I am currently a student in
              the Georgia Tech Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and am
              excited to share some of my projects here.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this Code Refactoring Project, I was tasked with implementing
              semantic code elements for a business web site to optimize the
              user experience for guests using screen readers and provide best
              in class accessibility. Care was taken to maintain the look and
              feel of the current site as well as maintaining the proper user
              experience and interface. Both HTML and CSS elements were
              refactored and streamlined to make the code as dry and
              comprehensible.
