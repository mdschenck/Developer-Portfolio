          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, thanks very much for visiting my page. I am a web development
            student and designer based in Atlanta, Georgia currently working in
            specialty food E-commerce Digital Merchandising. I started building
            web pages back in the infancy of the world wide web in 1997,
            designing a page for my high school punk band which got a mention in
            a national magazine since we were one of the few bands who actually
            had a website at the time! Over the years, I've built many sites for
            different businesses I've been involved in, including multiple
            specialty food retailers, recording studios, and record labels. I am
            currently a student in the Georgia Tech Full Stack Web Development
            Bootcamp, and am excited to share some of my projects here.
          </p>

            <h2>Code Refactoring Project</h2>
            <p>
              In this Code Refactoring Project, I was tasked with implementing
              semantic code elements for a business web site to optimize the
              user experience for guests using screen readers and provide best
              in class accessibility. Care was taken to maintain the look and
              feel of the current site as well as maintaining the proper user
              experience and interface. Both HTML and CSS elements were
              refactored and streamlined to make the code as dry and
              comprehensible.
