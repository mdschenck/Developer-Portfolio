# Developer-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio is intented to provide prospective employers with a easy-to-navigate demonstration of my web development and design skills through my history of deployed projects.

The USER STORY for this project is as follows:

- AS A employer,
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

Given this user story, I strove to provide examples of my web development and design work, past and present. Over the last 10 years, I have deployed multiple web applications ranging from static web sites to functional business websites with music players and embedded social feeds and payment, all the way up to fully featured ecommerce sites on Magento and WIX platforms that provided functionality sufficient to run a business and capture all payments, process orders, etc. Through my work in the Georgia Tech Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I hope to fill this portfolio with intriguing, functional web applications over the next six months, focusing on my currrent work in ecommerce fulfillment and integrating web applications with our current Magento 2.0, AS4000, and Enterworks MANTIS PIM platforms.

## Useage

This is a basic web application that functions to give information about my web development and design portfolio, and give prospective employers insight into my development and design skills. It can be accessed via any modern and legacy web browser.

- hen the user is presented with the first application, the image is larger than that of the rest on the page.
