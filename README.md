# Developer-Portfolio

## Description

This excercise is intended to follow the journey of a support ticket placed by a marketing agency to make their existing website more accessible through refactoring the code to include proper semantic elements, comments, and alt image text.

The USER STORY for this project is as follows:
-AS A marketing agency,
-I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
-SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

Given this user story, this project took their existing codebase and refactored the code to remove multiple non-descriptive DIV elements and replace them with the proper semantic elements like HEADER, NAV, MAIN, ASIDE, and FOOTER.
Multiple redundant CSS elements were also combined and reorganized to facilitate better understanding of the site styling.

In the Html document, fixed one link that was not working due to a missing ID tag, verified proper function of the other two links. Also created ALT image text for all images to increase accessibility. To create the alt image for the main hero banner image, a SPAN was created with a role of IMG and a aria-label describing the image. Since this image does not contain any information not necessary to the understanding of the site, it is acceptable to have the image in the CSS without ALT text, but I felt it would be nice to be able to describe the image to a visitor using a screen-reader.

## Useage
